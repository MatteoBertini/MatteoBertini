## Hi there
I'm a Computer Science & Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano
I love learning by doing, exploring new technologies, and diving into projects just for the experience and knowledge they give me, even if they don't have immediate practical use

I work on video games, frontend websites, and fullstack applications, and I enjoy experimenting with tools like Unity, Unreal Engine

My philosophy is simple: every project, no matter how small or "useless", is a chance to learn something new. That's why I take on a variety of projects, sometimes purely for curiosity, sometimes to push my skills further, and sometimes just for the joy of creating
